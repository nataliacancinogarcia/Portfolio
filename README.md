|[Mains-electricity-by-country](https://github.com/nataliacancinogarcia/Scraping-Mains-electricity-by-country/blob/main/scraping-mains-electricity-by-country.ipynb)|Python|Electrical systems vary globally in plug types, voltages, and frequencies ⚡. Despite efforts to standardize these systems in some regions 🌍, many differences still exist worldwide. This notebook aims to scrape data from Wikipedia’s Mains electricity by country page 📄, providing a concise summary of the key electrical characteristics used in various countries 🔌.|
|[EIA_Energy_Consumption_Price_Expenditure_2022](https://github.com/nataliacancinogarcia/Scraping_Energy_Consumption_Price_Expenditure_2022/blob/main/scrapingenergy-consumption-price-expenditure-2022.ipynb)|Python|In this notebook, we focus on scraping energy data from the EIA.gov website, specifically examining Total Energy Consumption, Prices, and Expenditures by state for the year 2022. Using powerful web scraping tools like requests and BeautifulSoup 🕸️, we retrieve the relevant data and organize it into three separate tables:  Consumption ⚡ (measured in trillion Btu),  Prices  💲 (measured in dollars per unit), and Expenditures 💵 (measured in millions of dollars).|
